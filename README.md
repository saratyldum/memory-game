# Memory game

This is a grid-based game made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The memory game is a simple card game where you try to find all the pairs in as few moves as possible, flipping over two cards at a time.

The memory game's is a 3 x 4 grid, made of 12 cards. There is currently only one level but it would be easy to implement more by adding categories, a bigger grid, shorter time and so forth. 
The game is responsive, can be played using both keyboard and mouse, and should work on all devices.

### Rules
- Start by flipping one card over.
- If the second card you flip matches the first the card will stay flipped over.
- If the second card you flip does not match, both cards will be flipped back around and you start again.
- The move counter will increase every time you get a match or not.
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
